When the proxy server gets a request, it checks if the requested object is cached (i.e. server
already has the request webpage or file), and if yes, it returns the object from the cache, without
contacting the server.
If the object is not cached, the proxy retrieves the object from the server, returns it to you and
caches a copy of this webpage for future requests. (More details ​ here​ )
In case of any further requests for the same, the proxy must utilize the “If Modified Since”
header to check if any updates have been made, and if not, then serve the response from the
cache.
In practice, the proxy server must verify that the cached responses are still valid (that is, haven't
been updated) and that they are the correct responses to the client's requests.
